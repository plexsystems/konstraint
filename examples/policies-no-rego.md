## P0002: Required Labels

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:**

* Any Resource

**Parameters:**

* labels: array of string
  Array of required label keys.

This policy allows you to require certain labels are set on a resource. Adapted from <https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/blob/master/example/templates/k8srequiredlabels_template.yaml>

_source: [required_labels](required_labels)_

## P1001: Containers must drop all capabilities

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:**

* core/Pod
* apps/DaemonSet
* apps/Deployment
* apps/StatefulSet

Granting containers privileged capabilities on the node makes it easier
for containers to escalate their privileges. As such, this is not allowed
outside of Kubernetes controller namespaces.

_source: [container_deny_added_caps](container_deny_added_caps)_

## P1002: Containers must not allow for privilege escalation

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:**

* core/Pod
* apps/DaemonSet
* apps/Deployment
* apps/StatefulSet

Privileged containers can much more easily obtain root on the node.
As such, they are not allowed.

_source: [container_deny_escalation](container_deny_escalation)_

## P1003: Containers must not run as privileged

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:**

* core/Pod
* apps/DaemonSet
* apps/Deployment
* apps/StatefulSet

Privileged containers can easily escalate to root privileges on the node. As
such containers running as privileged or with sufficient capabilities granted
to obtain the same effect are not allowed.

_source: [container_deny_privileged](container_deny_privileged)_

## P1004: Pods must not have access to the host aliases

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:**

* core/Pod
* apps/DaemonSet
* apps/Deployment
* apps/StatefulSet

Pods that can change aliases in the host's /etc/hosts file can redirect traffic to malicious servers.

_source: [pod_deny_host_alias](pod_deny_host_alias)_

## P1005: Pods must not run with access to the host IPC

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:**

* core/Pod
* apps/DaemonSet
* apps/Deployment
* apps/StatefulSet

Pods that are allowed to access the host IPC can read memory of
the other containers, breaking that security boundary.

_source: [pod_deny_host_ipc](pod_deny_host_ipc)_

## P1006: Pods must not run with access to the host networking

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:**

* core/Pod
* apps/DaemonSet
* apps/Deployment
* apps/StatefulSet

Pods that can access the host's network interfaces can potentially
access and tamper with traffic the pod should not have access to.

_source: [pod_deny_host_network](pod_deny_host_network)_

## P1007: Pods must not run with access to the host PID namespace

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:**

* core/Pod
* apps/DaemonSet
* apps/Deployment
* apps/StatefulSet

Pods that can access the host's process tree can view and attempt to
modify processes outside of their namespace, breaking that security
boundary.

_source: [pod_deny_host_pid](pod_deny_host_pid)_

## P1008: Pods must run as non\-root

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:**

* core/Pod
* apps/DaemonSet
* apps/Deployment
* apps/StatefulSet

Pods running as root (uid of 0) can much more easily escalate privileges
to root on the node. As such, they are not allowed.

_source: [pod_deny_without_runasnonroot](pod_deny_without_runasnonroot)_

## P1009: PodSecurityPolicies must require all capabilities are dropped

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:**

* policy/PodSecurityPolicy

Allowing containers privileged capabilities on the node makes it easier
for containers to escalate their privileges. As such, this is not allowed
outside of Kubernetes controller namespaces.

_source: [psp_deny_added_caps](psp_deny_added_caps)_

## P1010: PodSecurityPolicies must not allow privileged escalation

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:**

* policy/PodSecurityPolicy

Allowing privileged containers can much more easily obtain root on the node.
As such, they are not allowed.

_source: [psp_deny_escalation](psp_deny_escalation)_

## P1011: PodSecurityPolicies must not allow access to the host aliases

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:**

* policy/PodSecurityPolicy

Allowing pods to can change aliases in the host's /etc/hosts file can
redirect traffic to malicious servers.

_source: [psp_deny_host_alias](psp_deny_host_alias)_

## P1012: PodSecurityPolicies must not allow access to the host IPC

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:**

* policy/PodSecurityPolicy

Allowing pods to access the host IPC can read memory of
the other containers, breaking that security boundary.

_source: [psp_deny_host_ipc](psp_deny_host_ipc)_

## P1013: PodSecurityPolicies must not allow access to the host network

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:**

* policy/PodSecurityPolicy

Allowing pods to access the host's process tree can view and attempt to
modify processes outside of their namespace, breaking that security
boundary.

_source: [psp_deny_host_network](psp_deny_host_network)_

## P1014: PodSecurityPolicies must not allow access to the host PID namespace

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:**

* policy/PodSecurityPolicy

Allowing pods to access the host's process tree can view and attempt to
modify processes outside of their namespace, breaking that security
boundary.

_source: [psp_deny_host_pid](psp_deny_host_pid)_

## P1015: PodSecurityPolicies must require containers to not run as privileged

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:**

* policy/PodSecurityPolicy

Allowing privileged containers can much more easily obtain root on the node.
As such, they are not allowed.

_source: [psp_deny_privileged](psp_deny_privileged)_

## P2001: Images must not use the latest tag

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:**

* core/Pod
* apps/DaemonSet
* apps/Deployment
* apps/StatefulSet

Using the latest tag on images can cause unexpected problems in production. By specifying a pinned version
we can have higher confidence that our applications are immutable and do not change unexpectedly.

The following snippet is an example of how to satisfy this requirement:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: redis
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: redis
          image: redis:6.2
```

_source: [container_deny_latest_tag](container_deny_latest_tag)_

## P2002: Containers must define resource constraints

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:**

* core/Pod
* apps/DaemonSet
* apps/Deployment
* apps/StatefulSet

Resource constraints on containers ensure that a given workload does not take up more resources than it requires
and potentially starve other applications that need to run.

_source: [container_deny_without_resource_constraints](container_deny_without_resource_constraints)_

## P2005: Roles must not allow use of privileged PodSecurityPolicies

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:**

* rbac\.authorization\.k8s\.io/Role

Workloads not running in the exempted namespaces must not use PodSecurityPolicies with privileged permissions.

_source: [role_deny_use_privileged_psps](role_deny_use_privileged_psps)_

## P2006: Tenants' containers must not run as privileged

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:**

* core/Pod
* apps/DaemonSet
* apps/Deployment
* apps/StatefulSet

**MatchLabels:** is\-tenant=true

Privileged containers can easily escalate to root privileges on the node. As
such containers running as privileged or with sufficient capabilities granted
to obtain the same effect are not allowed if they are labeled as tenant.
To take advantage of this policy, it must be combined with another policy
that enforces the 'is-tenant' label.

_source: [container_deny_privileged_if_tenant](container_deny_privileged_if_tenant)_

## P2007: Namespace deletion must be denied unless explicitly allowed

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:**

* core/Namespace

Prevent deletion of Kubernetes namespaces to avoid accidental or unauthorized removal of critical workloads.

_source: [namespace_deny_deletion](namespace_deny_deletion)_

## P0001: Deprecated Deployment and DaemonSet API

**Severity:** Warning

**Resources:**

* apps/DaemonSet
* apps/Deployment

The `extensions/v1beta1 API` has been deprecated in favor of `apps/v1`. Later versions of Kubernetes
remove this API so to ensure that the Deployment or DaemonSet can be successfully deployed to the cluster,
the version for both of these resources must be `apps/v1`.

_source: [any_warn_deprecated_api_versions](any_warn_deprecated_api_versions)_

## P0003: Title \_wórds\_ with\-punct\_uation\_ \!"\#$%&'\(\)\*\+,\./:;\<=\>?@\[\\\]^\`\{\|\}~mark 

**Severity:** Warning

**Resources:**

* \*/Pod

**MatchLabels:** \_test\_=true

**Parameters:**

* \_param\_name\_: array of string

This is only here to test and illustrate _punctuation_ / Markdown handling

_source: [policy_markdown_punctuation](policy_markdown_punctuation)_

## P2003: Containers should not have a writable root filesystem

**Severity:** Warning

**Resources:**

* core/Pod
* apps/DaemonSet
* apps/Deployment
* apps/StatefulSet

In order to prevent persistence in the case of a compromise, it is
important to make the root filesystem read-only.

_source: [container_warn_no_ro_fs](container_warn_no_ro_fs)_

## P2004: PodSecurityPolicies should require that a read\-only root filesystem is set

**Severity:** Warning

**Resources:**

* policy/PodSecurityPolicy

Allowing pods to access the host's network interfaces can potentially
access and tamper with traffic the pod should not have access to.

_source: [psp_warn_no_ro_fs](psp_warn_no_ro_fs)_
