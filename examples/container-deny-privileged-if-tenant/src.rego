# Privileged containers can easily escalate to root privileges on the node. As
# such containers running as privileged or with sufficient capabilities granted
# to obtain the same effect are not allowed if they are labeled as tenant.
# To take advantage of this policy, it must be combined with another policy
# that enforces the 'is-tenant' label.
# This is the example for @matchlabels.
