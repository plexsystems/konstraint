# Examples

An example directory when working with `Konstraint`

## Template and constraint creation

The `constraint.yaml` and `template.yaml` files in each example policy folder were auto-generated by running the following command from the root of the repository:

```shell
$ konstraint create examples
```

## Policies documentation

The `policies.md` file was auto-generated by running the following command from the root of the repository:

```shell
$ konstraint doc examples --output examples/policies.md
```

The `policies-no-rego.md` file was auto-generated by running the following command from the root of the repository:

```shell
$ konstraint doc examples --no-rego --output examples/policies-no-rego.md
```

## Lib folder

The `lib` folder is a `Rego` library to assist with writing policies for Kubernetes resources.

To use the library in your own project, you can use the `pull` command with [Conftest](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/conftest).

```shell
$ conftest pull github.com/plexsystems/konstraint/examples/lib -p lib
```

Alternatively, the `.rego` files can be manually copied to your lib directory.
