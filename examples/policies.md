## Containers must drop all capabilities

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:** apps/DaemonSet apps/Deployment apps/StatefulSet core/Pod

Granting containers privileged capabilities on the node makes it easier
for containers to escalate their privileges. As such, this is not allowed
outside of Kubernetes controller namespaces.

### Rego

```rego
package container_deny_added_caps

import data.lib.core
import data.lib.pods
import data.lib.security

violation[msg] {
    pods.containers[container]
    not container_dropped_all_capabilities(container)

    msg := core.format(sprintf("%s/%s/%s: Does not drop all capabilities", [core.kind, core.name, container.name]))
}

container_dropped_all_capabilities(container) {
    security.dropped_capability(container, "all")
}
```

## Containers must not allow for privilege escalation

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:** apps/DaemonSet apps/Deployment apps/StatefulSet core/Pod

Privileged containers can much more easily obtain root on the node.
As such, they are not allowed.

### Rego

```rego
package container_deny_escalation

import data.lib.core
import data.lib.pods

violation[msg] {
    pods.containers[container]
    container_allows_escalation(container)

    msg := core.format(sprintf("%s/%s: Allows privilege escalation", [core.kind, core.name]))
}

container_allows_escalation(c) {
    c.securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation == true
}

container_allows_escalation(c) {
    core.missing_field(c.securityContext, "allowPrivilegeEscalation")
}
```

_source: [container-deny-escalation](container-deny-escalation)_

## Images must not use the latest tag

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:** apps/DaemonSet apps/Deployment apps/StatefulSet core/Pod

Using the latest tag on images can cause unexpected problems in production. By specifying a pinned version
we can have higher confidence that our applications are immutable and do not change unexpectedly.

### Rego

```rego
package container_deny_latest_tag

import data.lib.core
import data.lib.pods

violation[msg] {
    pods.containers[container]
    has_latest_tag(container)

    msg := core.format(sprintf("%s/%s/%s: Images must not use the latest tag", [core.kind, core.name, container.name]))
}

has_latest_tag(c) {
    endswith(c.image, ":latest")
}

has_latest_tag(c) {
    contains(c.image, ":") == false
}
```

_source: [container-deny-latest-tag](container-deny-latest-tag)_

## Containers must not run as privileged

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:** apps/DaemonSet apps/Deployment apps/StatefulSet core/Pod

Privileged containers can easily escalate to root privileges on the node. As
such containers running as privileged or with sufficient capabilities granted
to obtain the same effect are not allowed.

### Rego

```rego
package container_deny_privileged

import data.lib.core
import data.lib.pods
import data.lib.security

violation[msg] {
    pods.containers[container]
    container_is_privileged(container)

    msg = core.format(sprintf("%s/%s/%s: Containers must not run as privileged", [core.kind, core.name, container.name]))
}

container_is_privileged(container) {
    container.securityContext.privileged
}

container_is_privileged(container) {
    security.added_capability(container, "CAP_SYS_ADMIN")
}
```

_source: [container-deny-privileged](container-deny-privileged)_

## Containers must define resource constraints

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:** apps/DaemonSet apps/Deployment apps/StatefulSet core/Pod

Resource constraints on containers ensure that a given workload does not take up more resources than it requires
and potentially starve other applications that need to run.

### Rego

```rego
package container_deny_without_resource_constraints

import data.lib.core
import data.lib.pods

violation[msg] {
    pods.containers[container]
    not container_resources_provided(container)

    msg := core.format(sprintf("%s/%s/%s: Container resource constraints must be specified", [core.kind, core.name, container.name]))
}

container_resources_provided(container) {
    container.resources.requests.cpu
    container.resources.requests.memory
    container.resources.limits.cpu
    container.resources.limits.memory
}
```

_source: [container-deny-without-resource-constraints](container-deny-without-resource-constraints)_

## Pods must not have access to the host aliases

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:** apps/DaemonSet apps/Deployment apps/StatefulSet core/Pod

Pods that can change aliases in the host's /etc/hosts file can
redirect traffic to malicious servers.

### Rego

```rego
package pod_deny_host_alias

import data.lib.core
import data.lib.pods

violation[msg] {
    pod_host_alias

    msg := core.format(sprintf("%s/%s: Pod has hostAliases defined", [core.kind, core.name]))
}

pod_host_alias {
    pods.pod.spec.hostAliases
}
```

_source: [pod-deny-host-alias](pod-deny-host-alias)_

## Pods must not run with access to the host IPC

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:** apps/DaemonSet apps/Deployment apps/StatefulSet core/Pod

Pods that are allowed to access the host IPC can read memory of
the other containers, breaking that security boundary.

### Rego

```rego
package pod_deny_host_ipc

import data.lib.core
import data.lib.pods

violation[msg] {
    pod_has_hostipc

    msg := core.format(sprintf("%s/%s: Pod allows for accessing the host IPC", [core.kind, core.name]))

```

_source: [pod-deny-host-ipc](pod-deny-host-ipc)_

## Pods must not run with access to the host networking

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:** apps/DaemonSet apps/Deployment apps/StatefulSet core/Pod

Pods that can access the host's network interfaces can potentially
access and tamper with traffic the pod should not have access to.

### Rego

```rego
package pod_deny_host_network

import data.lib.core
import data.lib.pods

violation[msg] {
    pod_has_hostnetwork

```

_source: [pod-deny-host-network](pod-deny-host-network)_

## Pods must not run with access to the host PID namespace

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:** apps/DaemonSet apps/Deployment apps/StatefulSet core/Pod

Pods that can access the host's process tree can view and attempt to
modify processes outside of their namespace, breaking that security
boundary.

### Rego

```rego
package pod_deny_host_pid

import data.lib.core
import data.lib.pods

violation[msg] {
    pod_has_hostpid

    msg := core.format(sprintf("%s/%s: Pod allows for accessing the host PID namespace", [core.kind, core.name]))
}

pod_has_hostpid {

}
```

_source: [pod-deny-host-pid](pod-deny-host-pid)_

## Pods must run as non-root

**Severity:** Violation

**Resources:** apps/DaemonSet apps/Deployment apps/StatefulSet core/Pod

Pods running as root (uid of 0) can much more easily escalate privileges
to root on the node. As such, they are not allowed.

### Rego

```rego
package pod_deny_without_runasnonroot

import data.lib.pods
import data.lib.core

violation[msg] {

## Deprecated Deployment and DaemonSet API

**Severity:** Warning

**Resources:** apps/DaemonSet apps/Deployment

The `extensions/v1beta1 API` has been deprecated in favor of `apps/v1`. Later versions of Kubernetes
remove this API so to ensure that the Deployment or DaemonSet can be successfully deployed to the cluster,
the version for both of these resources must be `apps/v1`.
